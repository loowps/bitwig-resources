* #### [Note Range (Download)](https://github.com/loowps/bitwig-resources/raw/main/Bitwig-v4.2/Note%20Range.bwpreset)
  A Note Grid preset which allows you to limit the input notes to a user defined range. The lower limit is set by Min and the upper limit by Max. Notes which exceed the limits are fold back by an octave +/-. You can change the priority of the calculation by toggling the Min->Max button.
