# Loowps Bitwig Presets

Feel free to use my presets in your Bitwig projects.

## ðŸ“‹ Presets

* #### [Note Range (Download)](https://github.com/loowps/bitwig-resources/raw/main/Bitwig-v4.2/Note%20Range.bwpreset)
  A Note Grid preset which allows you to limit the input notes to a user defined range. The lower limit is set by Min and the upper limit by Max. Notes which exceed the limits are fold back by an octave +/-. You can change the priority of the calculation by toggling the Min->Max button.

* #### [Seeded Random Melody (Download)](https://github.com/loowps/bitwig-resources/raw/main/Bitwig-v4.2/Seeded%20Random%20Melody.bwpreset)
  A Note Grid Preset which uses seeded pseudo random numbers to generate a melody with random pitch, velocity, step length and step on/off. This preset is meant to illustrate a possible use case and probably could be improved further or adapted to your use cases.
