# Loowps - Bitwig Presets

Presets I made for Bitwig which maybe are useful to you.

## Note Range

Note Range is a Note Grid preset which allows you to limit the input notes to a custom range. The lower limit is set by
Min and the upper limit by Max. You can change the priority of the calculation by toggling the Min->Max button.

[Note Range v1.0.0](https://github.com/loowps/bitwig-presets/raw/main/Bitwig-4.2/NoteRange.bwpreset) (2022-03-26, in v4.2.1)
