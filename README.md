## ðŸ“‹ Presets

### [Note Range (Download)](https://github.com/loowps/bitwig-resources/raw/main/Bitwig-v4.2/Note%20Range.bwpreset)

A Note Grid preset which allows you to limit the input notes to a user defined range. The lower limit is set by Min
and the upper limit by Max. Notes which exceed the limits are fold back by an octave +/-. You can change the priority
of the calculation by toggling the Min->Max button.

### [Seeded Random Melody (Download)](https://github.com/loowps/bitwig-resources/raw/main/Bitwig-v4.2/Seeded%20Random%20Melody.bwpreset)

A Note Grid Preset which uses seeded pseudo random numbers to generate a melody with random pitch, velocity, step
length and step on/off. This preset is meant to illustrate a possible use case and probably could be improved further
and adapted to your needs.

### [Loowps Sequencer (Download)](https://github.com/loowps/bitwig-resources/raw/main/Bitwig-v4.2/Loowps%20Sequencer.bwpreset)

A monophonic sequencer based on steps modulators with variable note length, probability, delay/shuffle, gate length, 
pitch, pitch lag, velocity and 16 midi CC values.

### [Draw SEQ (Download)](https://github.com/loowps/bitwig-resources/raw/main/Bitwig-v5.0/Draw%20SEQ.bwpreset)

A monophonic sequencer that uses a curve modulator as its note source. Values > 0 cause a note on event, 
semitone changes re-trigger the current note with the new pitch and values == 0 lead to note off events.

Turning quantization off and altering the curve speed of different sequencers
can lead to experimental / free form rhythms.
